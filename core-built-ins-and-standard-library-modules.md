The Built-in Scope



the built-in scope is just a built-in module called builtins, but

you have to import builtins to query built-ins because the name builtins is not itself

built in...

No, Iâ€™m serious! The built-in scope is implemented as a standard library module named

builtins in 3.X, but that name itself is not placed in the built-in scope, so you have to

import it in order to inspect it
